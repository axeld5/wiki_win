      "The Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) is the governing body of football in Portugal, formed in 1914 as the Portuguese Football Union. It joined FIFA in 1923 and is a founding member of UEFA. The FPF oversees all aspects of football in Portugal, including professional, amateur, and national teams. It has gone through various leadership changes, including controversies like the \"Saltillo Affair\" in the 1986 World Cup. In recent years, the FPF has hosted major events like the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals and is bidding to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup. The FPF is structured with various governing bodies, including the General Assembly, Board, Council of Justice, Disciplinary Board, Arbitration Council, and Fiscal Council.\n"
